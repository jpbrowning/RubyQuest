RubyQuest
=========

To run: "ruby RubyQuest.rb"

Ruby Quest is a game created by two students at USNA for their Programming Languages class. 

The game is a text base dungeon crawler RPG, with randomly generated rooms, objects, and characters the player interacts with.

This is our first real program in Ruby, which is why most of the classes are not very re-usable, and a lot of the code is messy.
